# AVR600
Hello!
This is the repository for the semester project for course AVR600.
The project is a simple exploration/collection game whose name I am yet to decide.
The game follows the player character, a squirrel, who goes around a forest and collects acorns for its acorn stash.
The level is a forest dotted with trees and rocks, with more unique decor on the list of items to be added should I find the time.
The UI is simple, with a counter on the top right keeping track of acorns collected and acorns left
A minimap will be added should time allow it
